We are software developers who know that the art of crafting quality code stems from dedicated practice. What sets us apart is our belief that writing code collaboratively not only enhances its quality but also makes the process more enjoyable.

Our primary goal is to foster a tight-knit community of developers who champion each other's growth by learning new skills together. Our gatherings are diverse, featuring guest speakers and interactive sessions where we collectively practice and refine both new and existing abilities.

Whether you have a preferred programming language, IDE, operating system, or testing framework, and whether you're a seasoned developer or entirely new to coding, your background doesn't define your place here. If you bring your imagination, curiosity and a computer, you are welcome.

Join us, and let's embark on this exciting coding journey together!
