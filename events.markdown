# Event Types

### Intro to Ensemble and TDD
- **Description:** This beginner-friendly session introduces ensemble programming and test-driven development (TDD). Learn to collaboratively code in real-time, discuss code, and grasp the basics of the red-green-refactor cycle by writing tests first. Whether you prefer to observe or dive into coding, all levels of participation are encouraged.
  
### Code Challenges
- **Description:** Beyond the intro to TDD, these sessions involve tackling specific problems as a group using mob programming. We strongly encourage active participation and provide a safe space for experimentation and learning from failures. To participate in code challenge events, we recommend having attended at least one Intro to Ensembling and TDD session or a previous code challenge event with our club, to be familiar with our norms and specific flavor of ensembling.

### Speaker Sessions
- **Description:** Hear from both local and global world-class developers. These sessions cover diverse technical topics, followed by Q&A opportunities.

### In-Person Coffee Events
- **Description:** Join us for relaxed gatherings where Calgary techies meet up to hang out, connect, and chill. These casual in-person meetups provide an excellent opportunity to network and build connections within our community.

### Participation Guidelines

To maintain our supportive environment, we ask attendees to:
- Treat each other with kindness, consideration, and respect.
- In remote events, we ask that you use cameras if possible for better communication.
